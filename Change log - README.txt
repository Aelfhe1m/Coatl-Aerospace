*********************************
Coatl Aerospace ProbesPlus! BETA
*********************************

Thank you for downloading and playtesting! I look forward to your feedback! -Akron

============
Known Issues:
============
- CA-R3900 RTG animation is slightly jumpy
- CA-R3900 RTG node for the magnetometer is oriented straight up, instead of an angle
- Not enough feedback on the Dev thread! Your feedback will help make the mod better!

Please note that the mod is still in BETA and there will be constant changes and updates. If you encounter any issues, please report them on the Github page or the forums!
