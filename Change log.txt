Coatl Aerospace Probes Plus! Beta
*********************************

Thank you for downloading and playtesting! I look forward to your feedback! -Akron

============
Known Issues:
============
- CA-R3900 RTG animation is slightly jumpy
- CA-R3900 RTG node for the magnetometer is oriented straight up, instead of an angle
- Not enough feedback on the Dev thread! Your feedback will help make the mod better!
