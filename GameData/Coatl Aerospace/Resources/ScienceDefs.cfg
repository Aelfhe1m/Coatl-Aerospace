		DresSrfLanded = The dust is so dense that it absorbs and scatters sun light.
		
		JoolInSpaceLow = No dust or the grains are too small to be recognized by the instrument.
				
		LaytheInSpaceLow = The dust tries to from a shape. We observed the same behaviour near Kerbin.
		LaytheSrfLanded = A loose granular material. Probably it consists of calcium carbonate.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = No grains are entering the sensor.
		
		VallInSpaceLow = Dust tries to form a shape. Lower density than water.
		VallSrfLanded = The cold seems to trap the dust particles on the surface.
		
		TyloInSpaceLow = Avoid this one, it is just a lot of dust and drag and means nothing in the end.
		TyloSrfLanded = Due to the high gravity the dust clumps together to spheres.
		
		BopInSpaceLow = The dust is clustering to dense cores.
		BopSrfLanded = Too much dust in the sensor.
		
		PolInSpaceLow = Dusting this one would be a good start.
		PolSrfLanded = Weak impacts. Probably phosporic or sulfuric origin.
		
		EelooInSpaceLow = Dust particles are few and far between. 
		EelooSrfLanded = The Dust consists of CO, silicon carbide, amorphous silicate and lots of ice.
