	RESULTS
	{
	default = Site Survey Complete
	default = Finished taking pictures of the landing site
	default = Sending landing site pictures for analysis
	
	MohoSrfLanded = That's not the landing leg melting, is it?
	MohoSrfLanded = Moho has less impact craters than we expected. The relatively smooth surface should be safe for future landings
	MohoSrfLandedNorthPole = Woah! Is that a hole on the surface? That looks unsafe
	
	EveSrfLanded = Eve's terrain appears safe enough to land, but not safe enough to take off again
	
		GillySrfLanded = Gilly's surface is mostly smooth with only small rocks scattered about
	
	KerbinSrf = Kerbin looks safe enough to land a crew without their space suits
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The camera captures a lot of eager interns and test subjects gathering around gawking at the spacecraft
	
		MunSrfLanded = The Mun's many craters create elevation changes challenging for manned landing, and shadows over solar panels when the sun is low on the horizon
		MunSrfLanded = This mosaic of images from the surface will get lots of likes in social media
		
		MinmusSrfLanded = Scientists look at the gray surface and think we've landed in the wrong moon. The engineers tell them that the camera does not take color pictures
		MinmusSrfLanded = Images show lots of big hills with awkward angles for landing, but also large flat and smooths areas
	
	DunaSrfLanded = No aliens in sight. Who build those canals?
	DunaSrfLanded = The surface appears very dusty but the terrain looks safe for Kerbonaut landings
	
		IkeSrfLanded = We like Ike. Very rocky surface with lots of smaller rocks scattered about for sampling
		
	DresSrfLanded = The landing site is very moon-like but less dusty. KSC determines it safe but boring for Kerbonaut missions
	DresSrfLanded = Images show many hills that could possibly impede safe manned landings. Val volunteers to land there anyway 
	
	JoolSrfLanded = If the survey lander made it safely, Kerbonauts should as well, right?
	
		LaytheSrfLanded = That's a lot of water! Future missions should be water-proof and buoyant just in case
		
		VallSrfLanded = The terrain is very uneven with some tall connected ridges that could be signs of tectonic activity
		
		TyloSrfLanded = The surface is very rocky and with some uneven terrain and big elevation changes
		
		BopSrfLanded = Analysis of Bop's interesting and very irregular terrain is undermined by the fact that someone swear they saw a tentacle
		
		PolSrfLanded = The surface is very irregular and spiky. There a lots of mountains and uneven valleys. Bring enough fuel for Kerbonauts to find a safe spot
		
		EeelooSrfLanded = Eeloo's surface is relatively smooth. The high reflectiveness of the surface material confirms ice coverage. The crew should bring ice skates
		
		//it's many crater impacts, some of which look recent, suggest that meteoroid impacts could be a danger to manned missions
